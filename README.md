# truthTableGenerator

This is a simple project to fulfill my honors contract proposal requirements for
my university discrete math course.

It has some (very minor) output formatting issues (closing parentheses aren't always perfect), 
but the program output is correct.

Anyone is welcome to make any changes to this that they wish to, I will merge any changes that fix bugs
or add functionality, or otherwise add to the project.
